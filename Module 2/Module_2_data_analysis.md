# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is to practice contructing tidy and usabe data rames and creating working readable data visualation.

{Provide a description of the data set that you are analyzing.  Include the link of where you obtained the data.}
Its a listed statisitcs of several key indicators on goverment stabilities for countries around the world from 1996 to 2014.

Taking the expansive csv file, reworking it into easily handeled dataframes and constucting new dataframes and charats around specfiic questions from information fromt he data, in this case, a comparison of goverment effectivness precentail rank.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}
Wanting to find the range of goverment effectiveness of select asian countries in 2008, found that in that year, the lowest goverment effectivness score was afghanistan. 

the second was to see a list of 5 countires goverment effectivness over the entire time frame, and saw some intresting changes in precential rank from around 2004 to 2008.

# Development Environment
