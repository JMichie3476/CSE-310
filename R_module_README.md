# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I'm trying to learn to operate in as many viable languages as possible for any further computation processes. I'm a physics major, so much of my programming experience and intent
in software engineering is focused on computation application in physics, an material science research.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the R language.}
This is a computational analysis of a csv data set, structured around specific functions and potential area's of inquiry for that data.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
To show off my ability to write computationally minded programming in the R language

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used R studio to write both my code as well as this README, I could have used visual studio, but I already had the relent libraries downloaded for R in R studio.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
THis is the R module, SO I used R, as well as the tidyverse library for its access to Dypler library for the csv read code.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 I really need to work on presenting in video format, I got way to nervous and I'm not use to recording myself
- Item 2 I really need to work on editing my comments, I proof read a lot of this, but I could do a lot better 
- Item 3 I should have mad this in a qmd file, I just stuck to a basic R notebook, but a qmd would have at least looked more presentable, esspecially if this is stuctured around making a qualitative anaylisis of data.
