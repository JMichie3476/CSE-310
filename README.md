# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}
THis is example code to run through and test my compantancy with Javascrpit, using refurive functions, es array functions, and outside node libaries.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
To show exprience and compantancy with javascript.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 - I'm still VERY new with javascript, I used a lot of basic funtions to test mu compitency because I wasn't confident using somthing too complex
- Item 2 - I spent too much time just commenting out my program in a basic ways instead of trying to use proper outputting methods.
- Item 3 - I REALLY need to trim down my videos, I'm just oo nervous speaking over a mike and not getting enough info out to properly show my code that I let my video's drag on.
