# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description for the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Erlang language.}
a selection of common use functions to test my ability to use Erlang, One to test sale prices and budget limit, one to check types of gems, one to filter elments lists, and another to test and run recusion functions.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
TO better understand and gain expirence in wrting in Erlang programin language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I used Visual studio code as my development enviorment, using the OTP erlang shell application for output my code.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used Erlang, with the OTP for some basic call libraries.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1 - I;ve been sticking to basic functions so far for the last two language modules, as I didn't have the confidence to try anything to complex. I need to break out and become more confident to try more coplex programing.
* Item 2 - I need to work on shorttening my videos, I'm way to nervous about missing any of my outputs that I run through way too much detail.
* Item 3 - I need to try and set up a better repository system for these modules, I listed everything under this one repository, so now I have to keep changing the README.
