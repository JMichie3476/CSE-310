# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I was trying to dreate an html file that would store and print data listed in the firebase database.
{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}
I created three files, and html that would print out a html pulling from the database, a app file that did the actual pulling from the database, and a style css file that would format the html into a presentable form.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I was trying to create a coded list of common isotopes for quick refrence for a number of elements.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}
I used Cloud firebase services to create a project and stored that date in a firestore collection.

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
I created a list of Elments: Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen then paired them with a string listing their more common isotopes, so carbon's list was printed as "12/13" meaning carbon12 and carbon13.

# Development Environment
I used visual studio code with the live server extention to print out my html product.

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
I initally tired to used firebase tools, but I couldn't get anthing outputted, so I found a tutorial on calling and printing out a function html script.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used javascript to pull the data with CSS style fileto make a more appealing html product
